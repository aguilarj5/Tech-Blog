Once cloned a command of "node install" can be run in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies of this project.

<a name="usage"/>

## Usage

This project could be used to as a way for users to discuss new upcoming technology, debate popular topics, and praise frameworks that are already widely used. This application serves as a way for those interested in tehcnology to learn from one another.

Once all necessary files are cloned and the package dependencies are installed, the user can run a command of "npm run seeds" in the terminal to create the starter data in the database. After this, the user can use a command of "npm run dev" or "npm start" to begin listening on the corresponding PORT.

From there the Tech Blog homepage/pages will be the main interface for interacting with the database and site features.
